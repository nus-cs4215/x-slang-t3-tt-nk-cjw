# Evaluator

There are 2 ways to evaluate our JS programs, transpilation and interpretation.

## Transpilation

We transpile the entire Racket FEP program into Javascript, then use the Javascript runtime to evaluate and run the program.

## Interpretation

As the program runs, we interpret each fragment of Racket FEP code as Javascript, then run it.
